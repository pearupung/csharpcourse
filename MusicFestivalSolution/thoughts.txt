copy eventset to minimise data loss

Track view should include add author form, add person form, 
    add trackauthortype form.
    
Track view create should include only main fields, addAuthor includes all
    other stuff: adding authors.
    
Every view with children should have one edit page that does not 
    touch its own values.
    
Track index is more of a event tracks set view. 
Event index is more like a set list/overview. Plus the venue. Plus any equipment
    you would have at a gig. Plus participants/setup team thing.
