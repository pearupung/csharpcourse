# Backlog
    - think about separating the menusystem and menu UI
    - think about separating the gameboard and the game UI

    - think about generalising the menu/menuitem components and behaviour 
        - having a property on menu items that specify on which levels they appear (strategy pattern?)
        - handling the toggle functionality more elegantly
        - pulling the menu structure from JSON or DB
